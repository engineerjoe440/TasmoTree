*PCB Layout for Tasmota Controlled (ESP8266) Christmas Tree Miniature Village Display*

### Summary:
This project primarily contains the hardware considerations for a Tasmota-based ESP32-centric control system for a
custom Christmas Tree design which has multiple "layers" or "tiers" which each support and hold parts of a miniature
villiage.

### Design Render:
The finalized PCB render is shown here:

### License:
This project is ultimately a custom design, but should not be thought of as "private", it is licensed openly such that
anyone interested may consume the existing design and modify as desired.
